<!-- Purpose of Application -->

## PURPOSE

The purpose of this application is to allow the user the ability to type in a city that they would like to find the weather out for. When selecting the city and searching, the application displays the current weather, as well as the five day forecast for that location. The city is then stored in local storage and displayed in the application as a previous search.

<!-- My Experience -->

## MY EXPERIENCE

Using a third-party API such as the weatherAPI was a great experience. Being able to take the data and minipulate it how it is needed to function in this application was a fun experience. Overall using the fetch and having that data to be able to manipulate was challenging but also allowed me to grow in that area
